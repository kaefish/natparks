            <h1>How to Become a Ranger</h1>
            <p>Park rangers are often said to be the keepers of our nation’s natural resources and protected public lands. Their mission it is to preserve and protect our nation’s local, state and national parks for public use and enjoyment today, and for many years to come. Park rangers are there to educate the public, enforce the law, as well as to implement and support conservation efforts so future generations can enjoy these ecologically and historically significant sites. </p>
            <h2>Earn a Degree in a Relevant Major</h2>
            <p>There is a wide range of academic majors relevant to working as a park ranger. Many aspiring park rangers choose to pursue degrees related to conservation, biology, botany, ecology, forestry, earth science, and anthropology, just to name a few.</p>
            <p>Some of the most relevant majors include:</p>
            <ul class = "body">
                <li>Park and recreation management</li>
                <li>Environmental studies</li>
                <li>Environmental science</li>
                <li>Environmental management</li>
                <li>Wildlife and Forestry</li>
                <li>Biological Sciences</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Although the National Park Service does not specify a particular major, they do require applicants to possess at least 24 credit hours in one or more of the following:</p>
            <ul class = "body">
                <li>Natural resource management</li>
                <li>Natural sciences</li>
                <li>Earth sciences</li>
                <li>History</li>
                <li>Archeology</li>
                <li>Anthropology</li>
                <li>Park and recreation management</li>

            <h2>What do Park Rangers do?</h2>
            <p>Park ranger jobs, whether at the federal or state level, tend to be varied, depending on the agency, the location, or the current needs of the agency. But what remains constant is the foundation of the career: working to conserve state or federally recognized natural and cultural resources.</p>
            <p>Parks and other important sites, whether recognized by the state or the federal government, are overseen by a force of park rangers who work to ensure that the cultural and environmental resources of the park are enjoyed not only today, but for generations to come.</p>
            <p>Park rangers may therefore be responsible for performing duties and operations related to some or all of the following:</p>
            <ul class = "body">
                <li>The park’s operations</li>
                <li>Interpretation</li>
                <li>Resource protection/management</li>
                <li>Patrol/law enforcement</li>
                <li>Public safety</li>
                <li>Programs and activities</li>
            </ul>
