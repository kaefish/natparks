            <h1>About the U.S. National Parks</h1>
            <p>The United States has 62 protected areas known as national parks that are operated by the National Park Service. National parks must be established by an act of the United States Congress. Criteria for the selection of national parks include natural beauty, unique geological features, unusual ecosystems, and recreational opportunities (though these criteria are not always considered together). Fourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS), while 21 national parks are designated UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR). Eight national parks are designated in both UNESCO programs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Twenty-nine states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. California has the most with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at approximately 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.2 million acres (211,000 km2), for an average of 870 thousand acres (3,500 km2) but a median of only 229 thousand acres (930 km2).</p>
            <br>
            <p>The national parks set a visitation record in 2017, with more than 84 million visitors and set a further record in 2018 with a 0.1% increase. The most-visited national park is Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, with over 11.3 million visitors in 2017, followed by Arizona's Grand Canyon National Park, with over 6.2 million. In contrast, only 11,177 people visited the remote Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in Alaska in the same year. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. Other units of the National Park Service (421 altogether) while broadly referred to as national parks within the National Park System do not hold the formal designation in their title.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>NPS Relationship with Native Americans</h2>
            <br>
            <p>NPS has a unique relationship with American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. It is founded in law and strengthened by a shared commitment to the stewardship of land and resources. The formal legal relationship between NPS and American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians is augmented by the historical, cultural, and spiritual relationships that these groups have with park lands, sites, vistas, and resources; they are their ancestral homelands and important resources in maintaining cultural identity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>NPS pursues open, collaborative relationships with American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to support cultural and traditional places and practices and enhance NPS’s understanding of the history and traditional management of places and resources that are now within national parks.</p>
